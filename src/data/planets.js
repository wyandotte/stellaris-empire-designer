    'name': 'Arctic',
    'description': 'Frigid, rocky world with a nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere. Significant water deposits can be found permanently frozen as glacial ice. Some life signs and vegetation, most of it clustered around the slightly warmer equatorial regions.',

    'name': 'Ocean',
    'description': 'Rocky world with a nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere and a significant hydrosphere. Oceans cover more than 95% of the surface, with scattered islands making up the remaining percentage. Abundant life signs, the vast majority aquatic.',

    'description': 'Rocky world with a nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere. Active and stable hydrosphere. Landmasses are separated by vast oceans, with large climate variations depending on temperature and precipitation. Significant biosphere.',

    'name': 'Tropical',
    'description': 'Humid, rocky world with a nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere. Seasons with significant precipitation are interchanged with drier periods. Most landmasses are covered in dense vegetation and there are abundant life signs.',

    'name': 'Desert',
    'description': 'Dry, rocky world with a nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere. Precipitation and major bodies of surface water are relatively rare. Significant temperature variations between day and night cycles. Scarce vegetation, with moderate life signs.',

  {
    'name': 'Arid',
    'description': 'Dry, rocky world with a nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere. The dust-covered terrain consists largely of mesas and canyons. Forests can be found in the more temperate polar regions, but vegetation is otherwise scarce. Moderate life signs detected.',

    'name': 'Tundra',
    'description': 'Cold and rocky world with a nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere. Permafrost covers most of the surface except for the more temperate regions by the equator. A stable biosphere exists but vegetation is mostly limited to mosses and lichens.',
